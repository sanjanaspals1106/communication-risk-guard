Fine. I guess I'll just do it myself since nobody else seems to care.

---

I thought you said you'd handle this. Whatever, I'll figure it out.

---

Must be nice to have so much free time. Some of us are actually busy.

---

Per my last email, which you apparently didn't read, the deadline is TOMORROW.

---

I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed. I expected more from you honestly.

---

Sure, let's go with YOUR idea again. It's not like my suggestions ever matter anyway.

---

Thanks for finally getting back to me. Only took three days...

---

Look, I don't want to be rude, but this is getting ridiculous. How many times do I have to explain the same thing?

---

I find it interesting that you always have time for their requests but mine somehow keep getting "lost."

---

No worries at all! It's totally fine! I'll just stay late AGAIN to fix this. Not a problem whatsoever! :)
